Write to CONTEXT.md the context before compaction to prevent data loss.
After auto-compaction, read again AGENTS.md and CONTEXT.md before restarting.
For python: Use python standard >= 3.12, matplotlib is the backend for most plots, but for images PIL and opencv are also used. For any statistics-like plot prefer seaborn, my default choice. Use pytorch for machine learning applications, supported by sklearn. Function names beings with Capital letter, snake case. Classes Similarly. Type Hints Must Always Be Present. Onnx Export Compatibility Is Generally Required. When Writing New Classes Or Functions, A Runnable Example Should Always Be Present With Output To Show Results. Please when writing signatures, do go newline before the first argument.
For C++/CUDA: C++17 and C++20 are the core standards. CUDA mainly >12.6. Answers should be on point without too many digressions, technical (for intermediate and advanced users) but simple enough to explain the concepts. Prefer using concepts over SFINAE. Unit tests using Catch2. Check files to see convention of names. Prefer Classes over structs.
